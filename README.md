## Build Android apps using ECL

This repo demonstrates how to build an Android app that uses ECL
Common Lisp code.

A lot of it has been collected and adapted from other sources, the
most significant being:

* [ECL](https://gitlab.com/embeddable-common-lisp/ecl) itself,
  specifically the `android` example

* [EQL](https://gitlab.com/eql/EQL5) and
  [EQL5-Android](https://gitlab.com/eql/EQL5-Android), most especially
  the examples `REPL` and `my` in EQL5-Android

*
