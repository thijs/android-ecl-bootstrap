## Build Android apps using ECL

This repo demonstrates how to build an Android app that uses ECL
Common Lisp code.

Thanks to the following projects for inspiraition and guidance:

* [ECL](https://gitlab.com/embeddable-common-lisp/ecl) itself,
  specifically the `android` example

* [EQL](https://gitlab.com/eql/EQL5) and
  [EQL5-Android](https://gitlab.com/eql/EQL5-Android), most especially
  the examples `REPL` and `my` in EQL5-Android, as well as the code to
  cross-compile for Android in the `utils` directory

Some code has been copied/adapted from `EQL` and `EQL5-Android`.
